## Installation

Install the bundle in your project directory:

```shell
$ npm install --save @conga/framework-view-twig
```

## Configure The View Engine

##### Global Configuration

In your app's configuration `app/config/config.yml`, set the default view engine for all routes 
that haven't already been assigned a view engine. 

```yaml
view:
    # the default engine to use when one isn't specified in @Template
    default.engine: twig
```

This will tell `@conga/framework-view` to use twig when rendering all templates that don't 
individually define their own view engines.

##### Route Specific 

You can specify the view engine with the `@Template` annotation, if you want to use twig for a 
specific route, while a different view engine is globally configured.

```javascript
/**
* @Route("/myRoute", methods=["GET"])
* @Template(engine="twig")
*/
myAction(req, res) {
    // the data you return is accessible inside your template
    res.return({ context: 'data' })
}
```
